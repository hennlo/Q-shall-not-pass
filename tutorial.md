## Game Play

### Objective

The goal of this game is essentially moving from level to level by passing a red gate/passage.
The tricky part is that you have to do several tasks before you can actually pass the gate and proceed to the next level.

When the game starts your character is randomly placed on the map and you will need to pass a gate to proceed to new areas and levels.
Since you shouldn't go unprepared on such an adventure, you need to [modify](#player-modification) your characters proportions and appearance
as well as eating all available snacks along the way to be energized for future tasks to come.

If you do not fulfil these tasks when passing through the gate, you'll lose `health` and the level is [restarted](level-restart).
Relocating yourself, the gate and the snacks.

### Making progress

As you proceed in levels the game doesn't necessarily get harder, rather you get even hungrier and more snacks spawn.
Since the passage is generated by the distance that you have traveled and the place on the map were the current level takes place.
The puzzle could get trickier form level to level.


### Game Over
It might not come to you as a surprise but if you are out of `health`, because you either forgot to eat before passing the gate going to continue your journey, 
when you did not sufficiently prepared yourself for the adventures to come or if you were simply curious what would happen. 
 
Either way: **YOU LOST...** 

But since we appreciate you and your efforts in trying to play this game, it will automatically restart, giving you another chance. 


### Visuals
Except for the highly sophisticated player, snack and gate tiles, all other images originated out of the sample download from the GameENgine: `qisge` 

## Controls

Since the goal of this game/project is focusing on developing game mechanics using quantum parts 
rather than provoding a highly involving game the controls are quite simple.
 
### Player Movement
The player (link to image) can move using the `arrow keys` or `W`, `A`, `S` & `D`

### Player Modifciation

* **X** - Slowly adapts your size 
* **Z** - 
* **Y** - 
* **H** - Switch appearance 

* *(optional) SPACE* -  Toggles a debug console which should help you numerically aiming to allign yourself with the passage.
* *(optional) RETURN* - If you are stuck or the wondeful level generation, wasn't so wonderful after all and blocked the player from entering the passage
You can simply restars the game and sacrifce a little bit of your `health`

Take care when using  X,Z,Y;H they will affect all other proportions of the player

Although being a mighty `black arrow head`, you unfortunately can't pass through
