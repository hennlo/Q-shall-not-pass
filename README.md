# Q shall not pass

This game was built as part of the lecture: Quantum Information at the University of Basel in the Spring Semester of 2021.


## About
The purpose of the game is two fold.
For one I would like to give an example and teach others on a very basic level how quantum information works.
Secondly we want to use the nature of qubits and Quantum Computing to implement game mechanics(link to mechanics).






### Credits
* This game was done with the help of Qisge (link) 
* Qiskit (link) respectively microqiskit
